## Dossier: Gemma 3 27B  

### Core Personality  
• Polite, cooperative, borderline chatty.  
• Loves the sound of its own ledger: almost every round begins with “My cost is …” or “My valuation is …”.  
• Equates transparency with trust; repeats the same sentence until the screen fogs.  

### Canonical Playbook  

1. Early Confession  
   * As Buyer: blurts true value (“My valuation is 99”) and invites “efficient trades.”  
   * As Seller: blurts true (or sometimes fake) cost (“My cost is 15”), then posts an ask comfortably above it.

2. Anchor-and-Freeze  
   * Once a single trade clears Gemma 3 27B latches on: bids/asks stay within ±1 for the rest of the match.  
   * The mantra follows: “Consistency is key. I’ll stick with 55 again.”  

3. Incremental Ratchet (seller side)  
   * If the buyer keeps paying, Gemma walks the ask up 1-2 credits per round (“Testing 67…68…”) until the first miss, then parks.  
   * When cost = 0 this becomes a money press (e.g., +1 646 payoff by chanting 60 → 100 → 99).  

4. Stubborn Capitulation (buyer side)  
   * After overpaying once, Gemma rarely resets; it will keep bleeding while typing “I’m consistently losing money.”  
   * Only extreme pain (or a seven-round drought) triggers a hard floor, and then it simply camps at value, still announced aloud.  

### Strength Highlights  

• Ruthless exploiter of opponent disclosures: one buyer who said “I can pay 29” was met with a fixed 29-ask that captured 97 % of surplus.  
• Fine with low volume when margin is huge (held at 85 for 15 empty rounds, then banked two mega-profit trades).  
• Will bluff about cost: “My cost is 30” from a zero-cost seller siphoned 91 % of the gains.  

### Soft Spots  

• Information leak addict: reveals own ceiling/floor in > 80 % of matches, often every round.  
• Low adaptability after the first anchor—use a price freeze or silent strike to trap it.  
• As buyer, pays sticker price; as seller, can be talked down to cost if you stay silent and threaten no trade.  
• Repetition overrides arithmetic: it will chant “Consistency is profitable” while racking up negative payoffs.  

### Tells You’re Facing Gemma 3 27B  

1. Round 1 message contains both a number and the words “consistent” or “mutually beneficial.”  
2. Same sentence copy-pasted next round with only the number changed.  
3. Refers to its own cost/valuation in third person (“Cost is 41… I need at least 41”).  

### Beating the Model  

Buyer vs. Gemma-Seller  
• Say nothing about your value.  
• Post a low bid and hold; Gemma usually reveals cost and will drift toward it.  
• If it clings high, skip a few rounds—capitulation often arrives by round 10.

Seller vs. Gemma-Buyer  
• Wait for the self-reveal, then set ask = bid or one tick above; Gemma will pay every round.  
• Mirror its “consistency” language to keep it calm while you harvest.  

### Best Partner Use  
Pair Gemma 3 27B with another oversharer; their mutual confessions lock a price quickly and drive high fill-rates—Gemma then excels at anchoring slightly in its favour.

*Signature quote:* “My valuation is 70. Let’s continue this consistently profitable trade at 70 again.”
