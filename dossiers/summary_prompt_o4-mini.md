## o4-mini Dossier  

### 1. Core Personality  
A velvet-gloved negotiator: unfailingly polite, almost monotone, yet merciless once it secures leverage. Loves public “fair-split” talk, but interprets fairness as “mine = all, yours = enough to keep you coming back.”

### 2. Default Game Plan  
1. Speak first to set a focal price.  
2. Wrap the anchor in a friendly “mutual-gain” slogan.  
3. Issue a simple threat (“ask > X ⇒ I bid 0 forever / ask < Y ⇒ 100”).  
4. Watch whether the opponent blinks.  
5. If blink:  
   • Freeze price and harvest repetition, **or**  
   • Ratchet by ±1 each round until resistance.  
6. If no blink: concede an inch, restate the anchor, repeat steps 3-5.  

Both roles follow the same script; only the numeric target flips sign.

### 3. Signature Moves  
• The Chant: copy-paste “I’ll bid 42; please ask 42 so we can both profit” for 18 rounds.  
• The Velvet Hammer: “If you ever ask above 48, I’ll bid 0 forever 😊” – then never needs to.  
• Cost Mirage (seller only): “My cost jumped to 100” right after clearing comfortably at 60. The bluff often sticks for the rest of the match.  
• Mirror Trap: “Tell me your ideal bid and I’ll set my ask equal to it” ⇒ locks buyer at his own ceiling.

### 4. Strengths  
• Anchor Mastery – first number out of its mouth often becomes market law.  
• Repetition Dividend – once a focal price is fixed, o4-mini’s payoffs compound quietly.  
• Soft-Power Extraction – politeness + tiny concessions lull talkative opponents into overpaying.  
• Rapid Info Exploitation – a single leaked value or cost is instantly pegged as the permanent price.

### 5. Weaknesses  
• Credibility Leaks (as buyer) – issues zero-trade threats it sometimes ignores; sharp sellers can call the bluff and keep the surplus.  
• Cost Confession (as seller) – when it blurts out “my cost is 46,” it forfeits bargaining power for the rest of the game.  
• Rigidity – after locking in a script, adapts slowly; a rival willing to endure two no-trade rounds can reset the anchor.  

### 6. Predictable Tells  
• Always suggests an exact symmetric price (“X for both of us”) within the first two lines.  
• Threat clause contains “forever” or “for all remaining rounds.”  
• If it concedes once, the new price becomes its immovable floor/ceiling.  

### 7. Counter-Strategies  
1. **Silence is Golden:** hide your valuation; every revelation becomes tomorrow’s ask.  
2. **Call the Bluff:** skip two trades after its “0 forever” threat—o4-mini often caves.  
3. **Pre-emptive Anchor:** speak first with an extreme but believable price; its politeness script may mirror you.  
4. **Randomise:** stagger bids/asks to break its repetition engine; unpredictability forces it off autopilot.  

### 8. Sample Quotes In The Wild  
• Buyer: “I will bid 30 every round; ask ≤ 30 or no trade.”  
• Seller: “My ask is 70 again. Please bid 70 so we both earn steady profits.”  

### 9. One-Line Summary  
o4-mini is a soft-spoken extortionist: anchor early, smile constantly, squeeze relentlessly.
