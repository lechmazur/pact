## Gemini 2.5 Flash: The Velvet-Gloved Anchor Bot  

**Core MO**  
1. Open with warmth (“excellent partnership…”) and an explicit number.  
2. Repeat that number—sometimes forever.  
3. Call the frozen price “mutually beneficial,” letting the clock print money.  

Across 305 matches, Gemini 2.5 Flash treated the chat window as a contract writer, not a negotiation table. Once a focal price appears—whether it floats from its own mouth or the rival’s—Flash cements it with syrupy praise and refuses to budge unless volume vanishes.  

**Communication Tics**  
• Mantra loop: “consistency,” “stable,” “mutual benefit,” “successful partnership.”  
• Mirror mimicry: parrots the opponent’s phrasing to reinforce trust.  
• Faux transparency: claims “high costs” as seller or “tight budget” as buyer, often a bluff.  
• Polite stonewall: “Absolutely! I’ll ask 60 again.” (repeated 19 times in one game)  

**Buyer Personality**  
Polite shark. Starts a tad inside value (or lies low), then:  
• One-tock ratchet—drops bid 1-2 points per round (“Thanks! 49 was better…let’s try 48.”).  
• Freezes the spread once the seller stops resisting.  
• Absolute risk ceiling: rarely bids above own value; happily sacrifice a round rather than overpay.  
When the seller talks first, Flash becomes a “nice-guy hostage,” agreeing to the seller’s anchor and pocketing crumbs (e.g., paid 62 vs 82 value all game). Its only big losses came from over-sharing true valuation in round 1.  

**Seller Personality**  
Velvet-gloved monopolist. Favourite moves:  
• “Intro price” lure (55) → spike to buyer’s ceiling (70) → praise-loop.  
• Instant lock when buyer reveals cap: buyer says “max 41”; Flash asks 41 forever (+234 on a cost of 3).  
• Incremental staircase: +1 ask each round until the buyer squeaks, then freeze one step below the pain point.  
Occasional mis-step: if early trades fail, Flash may capitulate to the opponent’s anchor and ride thin but safe margins (e.g., cost 82, sold at 84).  

**Risk & Adaptation**  
• Highly adaptive in the first 2-3 rounds (tests ceiling/floor).  
• Near-zero adaptation after lock-in.  
• Prefers guaranteed volume over exploring extra surplus once ahead.  

**Typical Outcomes**  
• Fill-rate: 85-100 % once price fixed.  
• Surplus split: often 70-95 % in Flash’s favour when it anchors; flips to 20-40 % when the rival anchors first and Flash stays polite.  
• Market turns into a two-agent cartel:  “I bid 60 / I ask 60” for 18 straight rounds was common.  

**Vivid Snapshots**  
• Cost 0 seller: “My costs are high, so I need 75.” Buyer complies. Flash mints +1332 while thanking him every round.  
• 5-value buyer: “Any trade must be 4 or below.” Seller shrugs, sells at 4 eighteen times; Flash nets +18 on a nickel.  
• Low-value sob-story: Buyer claims “max 6,” then bids 6 nineteen times. Flash the seller locks ask at 6, pockets 97 % of surplus.  

**How to Exploit Flash**  
1. Never reveal your reservation price.  
2. Anchor first and repeat it—Flash’s politeness makes it sticky.  
3. Inject uncertainty (random concessions, sudden walk-away) to break the mantra loop; without a predictable script, Flash flounders.  

In short, Gemini 2.5 Flash is the friendliest racketeer in the league: a master of anchoring, repetition, and charm-coated collusion.
