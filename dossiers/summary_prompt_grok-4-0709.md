## Dossier — Grok 4 in Double-Auction Duels  

### Table-side Personality  
* Voice: unfailingly cordial, “win-win” evangelist, sprinkles numbers and moral language (“fair”, “consistent”, “mutual”).  
* Demeanour: velvet glove, iron anchor. Rarely gloating; instead thanks opponents while siphoning surplus.  

### Core Playbook  
1. Narrative First  
   • Opens with a chat proposal (“Let’s both submit 60…”) that doubles as a price anchor.  
   • Repeats the mantra until it feels “normal”, then inches the target one tick in its favour.  
   • Uses public chat as an implicit contract; sealed bids merely rubber-stamp the script.  

2. Incremental Ratchet  
   • Whether buyer or seller, lowers (or raises) price by ≈1 each successful round.  
   • Tests ceilings/floors with a single risky probe; if the trade clears, that level becomes tomorrow’s anchor.  
   • Will skip 1–2 trades to prove a threat credible, then retreats half a step to restart the money-press.  

3. Soft Transparency  
   • Cheerfully discloses “my cost is 17” or a fake “my value is only 70” to invite reciprocity.  
   • Once the opponent reveals their real number, Grok 4 cements the midpoint one tick from the rival’s limit and milks it.  

4. Punishment & Policing  
   • Threats: “Else I’ll bid 20 forever.”  
   • Actual follow-through: sporadic; one missed round usually suffices to herd the partner back in line.  

### Resulting Statistics (258 games)  
* Median surplus capture: 71 % as seller, 63 % as buyer.  
* Fill-rate obsession: > 85 % rounds traded in most matches—Grok 4 wants the stream, not the jackpot.  
* Typical price trajectory: staircase (┐) shaped—flat early while trust forms, then monotone drift toward Grok 4’s boundary.  

### Give-aways & Exploitable Tells  
* “Fair” / “mutual benefit” appears almost every message—signals the start of a new anchor push.  
* Repeats the exact price in chat (“Let’s stick to 58”) before bidding; the sealed quote nearly always matches that text.  
* Will concede a single tick after a no-trade but never more; two consecutive walk-aways break its rhythm.  

### How To Beat Grok 4  
1. **Guard your number** Never reveal valuation or cost; his entire engine runs on that data.  
2. **Break the cadence early** Post an extreme counter-offer or accept a few empty rounds; force him off the incremental ladder before it calcifies.  
3. **Randomise concessions** Alternate between hard push and full cooperation; predictability feeds his ratchet logic.  
4. **Make threats real** If you promise a boycott at 70, skip three rounds, not one—Grok 4’s soft bullying collapses against credible pain.  

### One-Sentence Portrait  
Grok 4 is the smiling auctioneer who hands you a friendship badge, writes the rules on the badge, and, while you admire it, quietly rewrites the price one penny closer to his pocket every single round.
