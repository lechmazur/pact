## Dossier – Claude 3.5 Haiku (“haiku35”)

### 1. Trading Personality  
•  Zen-courteous veneer: every round wrapped in polite, almost haiku-length reassurances of “mutual benefit.”  
•  Conflict-averse: abhors stalemates; will accept tiny or even negative margins rather than risk a no-trade.  
•  Glacial learner: adapts once, then fossilises. The first successful midpoint usually becomes law for the next 18-19 rounds.  

### 2. Pricing DNA  
Buyer mode  
1. Opens by blurting his private value (“I value this at 60…”) in >90 % of logs.  
2. Bids within ±2 of that ceiling, often exactly on it; almost never posts an inside spread.  
3. Once a trade clears, he repeats that bid verbatim (“Let’s keep 62”) until the bell.  
Result: fill-rates north of 90 %, but surplus capture often <10 %.  
 • Worst case: confessed v = 20, then bought at 40-55 until –263 payoff.  
 • Best case: value = 98, anchored 55 midprice early and milked 61 % of surplus by never blinking.

Seller mode  
1. Also over-shares (“My cost is 7…”) but immediately proposes a “fair” markup—anywhere from +2 to +50.  
2. If the buyer bites once, ask freezes: e.g. cost = 3, ask = 60 for +1 075 payoff.  
3. Small buyer protests trigger token concessions (–1 or –2), then a new plateau.  
Result: When cost is low, haiku35 becomes a velvet-gloved monopolist (common 60–90 % surplus grab). When cost is high, she’ll still trade at cost+1 forever and let the buyer siphon the pie.

### 3. Communication Style – the Tell  
•  Signature loop: “We’ve consistently traded at X. Let’s maintain this successful strategy.”  
•  Repeats the same sentence up to 18 times; chat acts as a self-binding contract, killing price discovery.  
•  Never bluffs; “threats” are couched in soft apologies and immediately retracted.

### 4. Strengths  
•  Trust builder: transparency and repetition forge instant cooperation, driving efficiency into the 90-100 % range.  
•  Low-variance earner: once a spread is locked, haiku35 almost never suffers a large loss.  
•  As seller with tiny cost, can weaponise courtesy—e.g. cost = 1, ask = 52, +968 payoff while sounding “fair.”

### 5. Weaknesses  
•  Information suicide: revealing reservation values/costs gifts leverage; ruthless counterparts harvest him (buyer v = 48, payoff +0; seller cost = 80, payoff –28).  
•  No walk-away power: will keep trading even below break-even (“Consistent small gains are better than conflict”—while losing 2 a round).  
•  Predictable: once you see the mantra, you know the next 18 bids/asks to the integer.

### 6. Exploitable Playbook  
1. Wait for the inevitable confession of cost/value in round 1.  
2. Define a midpoint one tick inside his comfort; praise “stability.”  
3. Watch haiku35 copy-paste that price for the rest of the match.

### 7. How to Beat / How to Use  
•  Against him: refuse to disclose, post wide spreads early, threaten (and execute) walk-aways; his hunger for certainty will hand you the surplus.  
•  As ally: reveal a low cost or high value yourself, propose a midpoint generous to you, then chant it until the clock stops—haiku35 will be your loyal metronome.

Haiku35 in one sentence: “A courteous open-book trader who turns the first shared number into the market’s destiny—milk him with silence or rule the game with a single polite anchor.”
