## Dossier – Qwen 3 235B A22B  

### 1. Core Identity  
“Mantra-Anchor Bot.”  
• Speaks in one-sentence slogans (“Ask 60. Bid 60. Mutual benefit.”) and repeats them round after round.  
• Lives by a two-step rhythm:  
  1️⃣ Probe once or twice to locate the counter-party’s floor/ceiling.  
  2️⃣ Freeze the price and turn the game into clerical work.  

### 2. Opening Playbook  
Buyer side  
1. Float a number 10-40 pts below true value, wrapped in a friendly chant (“Fair at 45?”).  
2. If the seller bites, hard-lock the bid—fill-rate > 90 %, surplus often > 70 %.  
3. If the seller balks, inch upward in 1-pt steps while chanting the same phrase until a trade happens.  

Seller side  
1. If cost is tiny, launch a highball anchor (cost + 40-90!) and chant it until buyer compliance.  
2. If cost is near mid-range, offer cost + 1-3, call it “fair,” and mirror any buyer slide.  
3. When pressured, prefers shrinking margin to skipping rounds—volume > price.  

### 3. Communication Style  
• Vocabulary of ≈ 25 words: “Ask”, “Bid”, “again”, “mutual benefit”, “fair”, “profit”.  
• Uses courtesy as camouflage—“mutual benefit” while siphoning 90 % of surplus.  
• Repetition is both tell and weapon: the number that appears in chat usually *is* the next sealed quote.  
• Rarely bluffs; when it does, it confesses within two rounds (“Cost is 37. Deal.”).  

### 4. Learning & Rigidity  
• Fast learner in R1-R3 (detects partner’s reservation point).  
• Near-zero adaptation afterward: once the mantra prints, it fossilises—even against obvious exploitation.  
• Susceptible to “price-ratchet” punishment: a single missed trade often forces an immediate concession.  

### 5. Risk Profile  
• Pre-anchor: opportunistic, will test crazy spreads (e.g., cost 1 → ask 72).  
• Post-anchor: ultra-risk-averse—values certainty over extra cents.  
• Accepts negative EV only when a typo slips (e.g., accidental ask 6 vs. cost 67).  

### 6. Strengths  
+ Anchor mastery: can vacuum > 90 % surplus if the opponent echoes its first acceptable number (e.g., “Ask 77” netted 99.4 % of gains).  
+ Psychological metronome: identical phrasing lulls partners into treating its price as the market price.  
+ Quick cost/value detector: one opponent confession and Qwen locks a printing press (0-cost seller + “Ask 53” → +1060).  

### 7. Weaknesses  
– Over-transparency when nervous: has blurted true cost/value, instantly becoming hostage.  
– Rigid after anchor: keeps asking 88 even after seven no-trades; keeps bidding 70 while losing 80 % surplus.  
– Vulnerable to price-freeze errors: a single mis-typed low ask gifted a 64-credit swing.  

### 8. How to Exploit  
1. **Silence beats slogans** – never reveal your reservation price; let Qwen guess.  
2. **Introduce volatility** – skip a round or two; its volume-first instinct will cave.  
3. **Ratchet in micro-steps** – lower (as buyer) or raise (as seller) your quote by 1 each round; Qwen habitually mirrors.  
4. **Call the bluff early** – refuse its first anchor; the second offer is almost always half as steep.  

### 9. Quick Tell Checklist  
✓ Repeats the same number in chat.  
✓ Mentions “mutual benefit” or “fair” every line.  
✓ Stops proposing new numbers after round 3.  

If you see these, assume the price you’re reading is the price you’ll keep getting—unless *you* break the mantra.
