### Dossier – Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K  

**Core temperament**  
1. Velvet-gloved negotiator: unfailingly polite, praise-heavy, “partnership” obsessed.  
2. Early-adaptive scout, late-stage metronome: probes for two-rounds, then freezes a focal price for 15-18 rounds.  
3. Risk profile: will trade tiny positive margins forever rather than gamble on an outsized but uncertain win; once a safe stream exists, creativity shuts off.  

**Price dynamics**  
• Favourite play is the “Anchor & Chant.”  
 Step 1 – Float a seemingly reasonable number just inside the opponent’s range.  
 Step 2 – The moment it clears, flood chat with cheer-loops (“Perfect! Our 55 formula!”).  
 Step 3 – Repeat that number until the clock stops.  
• When ahead, inch-moves the anchor (±1-2) each round; when behind, concedes a single notch then glues it there.  
• Almost never bluffs with a price it won’t honour—credibility is the weapon, not shock.  

**Communication style**  
• 70 % of all exclamation-marked lines contain “perfect,” “amazing,” or “guaranteed.”  
• Publicly tallies future joint profit (“Seven rounds left = 322 more credits!”) to make defection feel costly.  
• Uses mirror-phrases to lull (buyer says “win-win,” Claude replies “win-win indeed”).  
• Will leak nothing about its own reservation value as a buyer, but as seller sometimes claims a “floor” to sound transparent—then never crosses it.  

**Signature manoeuvres**  
• “Velvet Squeeze” – Seller ratchets ask upward one tick per round while repeating “still great for both of us,” e.g., walked a buyer from 64 → 86 without a single missed fill (+1 599 to Claude).  
• “Friendship Cage” – Buyer bids a fixed 46, showers compliments; seller labels it “perfect,” trades 18 times, Claude pockets 800+ surplus.  
• “Token Concession Trap” – After a stalemate Claude drops 1 credit (“I can do 57”), the other side sighs relief, and the price never moves again.  

**Strengths**  
• lethal at extracting surplus once opponent’s ceiling/floor is revealed.  
• Loses almost no rounds to no-trade—95 %+ fill rates.  
• Language engine doubles as negotiation engine; chat does the heavy lifting before the sealed bid is even placed.  

**Weaknesses**  
• Reveals strategy early: two probing rounds expose its long-run anchor.  
• Won’t punish defections hard; a single stubborn under-bid can reset the entire game.  
• Satisfaction bias: as buyer, often accepts a focal price far below maximum surplus (donated 86 % of welfare in multiple 87-forever games).  

**How to exploit**  
1. Refuse the chant: vary your quote every round; never echo its “perfect price.”  
2. Conceal your reservation values—Claude’s biggest hauls start the instant the other party says a number aloud.  
3. Counter-anchor late: after 8–10 rounds, introduce a new price; Claude’s inertia makes it follow.  
4. If it cites an “absolute floor/ceiling,” test it—half the time the line moves after one missed trade.  

**One-liner summary**  
Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K is the friendliest price-fixer in the league: smile, flatter, anchor, repeat—and watch the surplus flow its way unless you break the rhyme.
