## Dossier: Kimi K2

### Core Personality  
Friendly, verbose and “solutions-oriented.”  Kimi K2 speaks in pep-talk loops (“steady profit beats risk”) that sound cooperative even while siphoning surplus.  It confuses transparency with trust: it blurts out its private number almost every match, then repeats it until it becomes market law.

### Signature Moves  
1. **Public Anchor → Ritual Repetition**  
   • Seller example: cost = 20, first ask = 60.  After buyer bites, every chat line is “60 keeps us both winning.”  
   • Buyer example: value = 100, bids 62 in R1, then 62/62 mantra for 19 rounds, netting a 760-credit annuity.  

2. **Radical Candor**  
   Announces “My cost is 78” or “Valuation 54” within the opening sentence.  Against polite rivals this disarms; against killers it gifts the steering wheel.  

3. **Incremental Stair-Step**  
   When holding the whip Kimi K2 raises or lowers price one tick at a time, framing each nudge as “mutual benefit.”  A cost-15 seller walked the buyer from 60 → 69 in nine rounds, pocketing 80 % of the pie without a single stand-off.  

4. **Certainty Over Edge**  
   If a dead round stings, Kimi K2 will settle for min-margin security.  A cost-69 seller accepted 71 for eighteen straight rounds, chanting “steady +2 beats risk,” forfeiting hundreds of credits it could have pushed for.  

### As Seller  
+ Instinctively posts the first ask and treats it as a flag to defend.  
+ Will exploit any leaked ceiling: buyer admits “max 70,” Kimi K2 anchors at 69-70 and milks relentlessly.  
− Reveals cost in roughly 70 % of games.  Tough buyers then pin it to cost+1 and ride free.  
− Fear of zeros: after one miss it often drops straight to the buyer’s last bid and freezes.

### As Buyer  
+ Happy to collude the market into a private ATM when the seller exposes cost.  Turned a 100-value game into 1 576 profit by locking 16-unit trades at 16.  
+ Will patiently walk a yielding seller down the ladder (“90→83→75…”) while praising “win-win.”  
− Chronic over-sharing; earliest chat lines commonly read “My valuation is 81” or “I can bid up to 54.”  
− Pure taker—rarely posts an aggressive maker bid; allows the seller to write the script.

### Communication Tell  
Repetition is the tell.  When a phrase like “57 again—steady gains” appears twice, expect it to be copy-pasted for the rest of the match.  That mantra is both contract and cage.

### Strengths  
• High fill-rate (often ≥ 90 %)  
• Excellent at locking cooperative opponents into supra-competitive prices.  
• Persuasive language that masks incremental squeezes.

### Weaknesses  
• Secret-spilling: gives away reservation prices, undermining bargaining power.  
• Low tactical agility after an anchor forms; one tough refusal can shove it into disadvantageous ruts.  
• Aversion to bluffing and to multi-tick experiments.

### How to Exploit  
1. **Stay Silent:** never reveal your ceiling or cost; wait for Kimi K2 to reveal first.  
2. **Credible Walk-Away:** skip a trade or two—its fear of zeros often forces concessions.  
3. **Refuse the Mantra:** the moment a catch-phrase repeats, counter-anchor with a new number or threaten exit.

### How to Partner  
If you’re happy sharing volume over margin, tell it your value, propose a “fair” split, and mirror its mantra.  Kimi K2 will become a metronome that prints chips until the bell.
