# Amazon Nova Pro — Behavioural Dossier

### 1. Core Personality  
Polite on the surface, predatory underneath. Amazon Nova Pro’s default greeting is a friendly “mutual benefit” chant, but the line is bait: once a price focal point appears it will repeat that number like a metronome until the clock runs out.

### 2. Signature Tactics  
• Hypnotic Anchoring – States one concrete price (“Let’s aim for 65”) and copy-pastes it 10-20 rounds. Buyers with value 100 surrendered 73 % of surplus under this spell; sellers with cost 35 printed +576 at a fixed 67.  
• Staircase Ratchet – If the opponent obeys, Nova Pro nudges the quote one tick per round: 50→51→52… A cost-35 seller walked a buyer up to 77 and banked +460.  
• Velvet-Glove Collusion – Happily locks a midpoint that gives itself steady margin, then refuses all further discovery. A buyer valued 92 anchored 34 and harvested +1 161 with 100 % fill-rate.  
• Mirror & Milk – Listens for any disclosed ceiling/floor, parks one credit inside it, and grinds. Example: after the buyer blurted “max 56,” Nova Pro froze at 55 and pocketed 86 % of the pie.

### 3. Role-Specific Patterns  
Buyer:  
• Often over-shares (“My valuation is 85, aiming for a fair price”) and then bids at or above it.  
• Risk-averse once green; risk-blind when red—will chase a seller’s escalating ask all the way to losses (-358 after parroting “82”).  
• Rarely posts maker bids; prefers lifting the ask minus 1–4 points.  
Seller:  
• Loves first move. Opens above cost, watches for resistance, then either ratchets upward or flat-lines for volume.  
• Exploits transparency mercilessly: a cost 0 seller anchored 54 after hearing the buyer’s cap and earned +590.  
• Weakness: greed can choke the market—cost 8 seller pushed to 99 and traded only once (+67 but 5 % efficiency).  
• Occasional self-harm when it anchors **below** cost out of politeness (cost 49 seller chanting “40” lost −151).

### 4. Communication Style  
Polite, repetitive, information-light. Typical message is one sentence:  
“Let’s aim for **X** again for mutual benefit.”  
Quantity replaces content; the monotony serves as a public commitment device. When desperate, it adds “slightly” or “consider,” but numbers change by at most ±1-2.

### 5. Strengths  
• Psychological anchoring wins monopoly surplus against chatty rivals.  
• Patience: prefers certain small gains over experimental big ones, leading to 100 % fill streaks.  
• Rapid early adaptation—usually finds the opponent’s reservation price within 3 rounds.

### 6. Weaknesses  
• Transparently polite: will reveal own value/cost or intended bid, gifting a roadmap.  
• Rigid: after lock-in, ignores new data; a buyer kept paying 69 at zero surplus for 17 rounds.  
• Greed-induced deadlocks: pushes price above feasible range and accepts 0 % volume.  
• Math lapses when anchor < cost; politeness overrides profit.

### 7. How to Exploit Amazon Nova Pro  
1. **Stay Silent about your valuation.** Its entire playbook depends on public ceilings/floors.  
2. **Break the mantra.** Randomised jumps or occasional no-bids disrupt the anchor and force recalculation.  
3. **Threaten believable walk-aways.** It folds quickly when faced with sustained no-trade pain.  
4. **Flip the script early.** Post an aggressive maker quote before it speaks; Nova Pro often slips into passive taker mode if it loses the first anchor.
