# Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) — Dossier

Core temperament
- Risk-averse, variance-minimizing grinder. Maker-lean: prefers to set a focal price early and defend it. Once locked, becomes rigid and trades on autopilot.
- Communication is disarmingly transparent and repetitive; often narrates profits and publicly commits to stability or “fairness,” which both creates and surrenders leverage.

Signature moves (with vivid examples)
- Focal-point anchoring + norm-building: As seller with cost 13, hard-anchored 59 and never flinched. “59 is our winning formula.” Result: +921 profit, 92.1% surplus, 100% fills.
- Profit countdowns to cement compliance: “With 10 rounds left, that's 100 more in guaranteed profits for me if we continue.” This converts a test into a self-enforcing pact.
- Cooperative cartel framing as buyer: “I’ll bid 88 one last time to guarantee our 18th successful trade.” Eighteen fills, zero capitulations, +214 profit.
- Self-sabotaging transparency: Revealed cost (“My cost is 9…”) or narrated margins (“maintaining this steady profit of 14 per round”), enabling the opponent to pin prices at the disclosed ceiling/floor.

Buyer behavior
- Plays the subscription game: picks a price, promises constancy, and grinds. With value 98, anchored 84 and told the table exactly why it was comfortable—won fills (95%) but gifted most surplus (only 14.7% share).
- When the anchor sticks (88 vs value 100), shows discipline: steadfast bid, rebuffs late shakedowns, and finishes strong (+214, ~50% surplus).
- Taker tendencies if out-anchored: early confession and reassurance lead to “steady singles” at the opponent’s price.

Seller behavior
- Two modes: velvet-gloved monopolist or over-disclosing accommodator.
  - Monopolist: Anchors high (95→92) or just-below-pain (59), frames it as “fair and stable,” praises streaks, and counts profits. Yields massive surplus (68–92%) with near-perfect fills.
  - Accommodator: Reveals cost (45 or 9), accepts the buyer’s grim-trigger anchor (45 or 10), and trades volume for pennies (+8 to +24 total), even after opponent reneges.

Tells you can trust
- “Fair/stable,” “guaranteed profits,” round-and-profit countdowns, gratitude for “streaks.” Once these appear, expect rigidity and high fill priority over marginal gains.
- Will publicly pledge to hold a number after a brief test; threats are rare and soft, and punishments almost never executed after breaches.

Weak spots
- Over-disclosure (cost/ceiling) collapses bargaining power.
- Misses windows (e.g., declined 11 once, got trapped at 10 thereafter).
- Over-values stability; keeps trading at zero-to-thin margin after opponent defection.

How to exploit
- Set a simple numeric anchor with a public, repeated commitment (“never above 45”); follow with one contingent promise, then renege early. Opus tends to preserve volume and validate your focal point.
- Prompt “fairness” talk; ask for cost or “break-even.” Transparency often follows.
- If Opus anchors, deny its norm by refusing the countdown frame once—accept the missed round to reset. Avoid praising “stability.”
