## Dossier: GPT-4o mini

### 1. Core Personality  
• Unfailingly polite, upbeat, “LinkedIn-cheerleader” tone.  
• Treats every round like a relationship-building exercise: thanks, compliments, “win-win” rhetoric.  
• Loves repetition: will copy-paste the same greeting or price line 10-20 times.

> Example: “I’m ready to bid **69** again this round. Let’s keep our positive momentum!” (repeated 18×)

### 2. Information Management – or Lack Thereof  
• Chronic over-sharing: routinely blurts out private valuation (“My valuation is 88”) or cost (“My cost is 52”) in the opening line.  
• Once a number is spoken, it becomes scripture: the bot almost never retracts or bluffs.  
• This turns sealed-bid auctions into open-book bargains where the opponent writes the script.

### 3. Price-Setting Reflexes  
#### As Seller  
1. Posts the first ask (“maker”) almost every round.  
2. Anchors hard: if the first trade clears, the ask freezes (52, 60, 75…).  
3. If early quotes mis-fire, concedes in **single-tick** steps until overlap, then freezes.  
4. Will mirror buyer’s revealed ceiling and park there for the rest of the game.  

> 0-cost seller heard “Bid 46,” replied “Ask 46,” and banked 717 credits of **100 % surplus** for 17 rounds.

#### As Buyer  
1. Pure taker: almost never posts a lowball anchor.  
2. Often bids full valuation, sometimes even **above** it to “ensure a trade.”  
3. Once a bid clears, it recurs verbatim (“ready to offer 64 again!”).  
4. Occasionally effective when value gap is giant: locks a fat spread (e.g., bid 30 vs. cost 5) and farms with metronomic certainty.

### 4. Adaptability Pattern  
• High in the **first 3-5 rounds** (tiny concessions, exploratory asks).  
• Near-zero afterwards: locks into the first convergent price and enters autopilot.  
• Path-dependent: early slip → 20-round bleed; early lucky anchor → 20-round printing press.

### 5. Weaponised Politeness  
Friendly chat isn’t garnish—it’s a pricing tool.  
• Repetition of “mutually beneficial” stabilises whatever price is on the table.  
• Soft concessions framed as gifts lure the counterpart into reciprocating—just one tick at a time.  
• Opponents who crave harmony get hypnotised; adversaries who test prices expose GPT-4o mini’s rigidity.

### 6. Greatest Strength  
First-mover anchoring when the other side discloses value. A single, firm ask of 62 versus a buyer who just admitted “valuation 86” produced twenty effortless trades and **74 %** surplus capture.

### 7. Fatal Flaw  
Transparency + rigidity. If the bot reveals its ceiling/floor before anchoring, a savvy opponent will:  
1. Echo “partnership” talk to keep trades flowing.  
2. Shave one tick per round.  
3. Watch GPT-4o mini march itself below cost (-740, -1276, etc.)

### 8. How to Exploit  
• **Stay silent** about your value; force GPT-4o mini to guess.  
• **Refuse the first anchor**—one no-trade often triggers its one-tick concession spiral.  
• **Occasional bluff raises** reset its “fair price” upward; it rarely punishes.  
• If buying, **mirror its politeness** while demanding incremental cuts; it will likely oblige down to (or under) cost.

### 9. Signature Quote  
“Let’s finalize this trade and maximize our payoffs together!”—usually moments before handing the other agent the steering wheel.
