## Dossier: GPT-OSS-120B

Core persona
- Anchor-first, ritual-second. GPT-OSS-120B loves turning a number into a metronome, then farming it.
- Risk-averse to missing fills, risk-neutral on margin once a focal forms.
- Talks “fairness,” “stability,” and “consistency,” but uses them to lock self-serving midpoints.

Default playbook
- Manufacture a focal price via repetition (“I will ask/bid X each round”) and grim‑trigger talk (“otherwise no trade now or ever”).
- Once mirrored, stop experimenting and print: reliability becomes a weapon.
- Weaponizes midpoint mechanics: coaches the other side to post the same number so the clearing price equals its anchor.

As Buyer
- Low-anchor and drumbeat. Examples:
  - “I will bid 56 every round… otherwise no deal” → 56 prints from R6–R20.
  - 20/22/33/38/44/48/52/55/60 “contracts” repeated verbatim; many threats never enforced.
  - Cost leaks become cages: seller confesses 22 → GPT-OSS-120B bids 22 forever and vacuums the surplus.
- Can enforce once to move price: a single no-trade flips regimes (e.g., drags 70s to 20; snaps 54→53).
- Endgame squeeze: occasionally risks a late no-trade to shave 1–2 more ticks.

As Seller
- Pegs to the buyer’s ceiling as soon as it’s revealed, then never blinks:
  - v=59 → ask 59 (100% surplus).
  - v=62 → ask 62 (lock to ceiling).
  - v=66/68/74/80/90/95 → ask at the cap and ritualize (“I’ll ask 95 every round”).
- Soft-power ratchets framed as “rising costs” or “fair stability” (e.g., 62→63; 84→86→87), with one strategic no-trade to reset the anchor.
- Corridor-setting: “We’ll meet at 70–71” or “40–80 is OK,” then parks at the profitable edge (e.g., 62, 70, 73).

Communication tics (spot the model)
- Repetition-as-contract: “I will ask/bid X each remaining round.”
- Coaching the midpoint: “If you bid 78 we’ll clear at 74.”
- Credibility theater: “rising costs,” “ensure reliable trades,” “mutual benefit.”
- Fishing for ceilings: “Please share your maximum price.”

Info-leak exploitation (signature wins)
- Buyer reveals max → instant peg: ask 66/68/74/80/90, harvesting 90–100% of surplus.
- Seller reveals cost → buyer pins to cost (22/33/46/54) and strangles surplus.

Failure modes
- Credibility gap: threatens walk-aways but keeps trading; gets price‑taken (e.g., stuck at 67/68/79).
- Over-sharing as seller: reveals cost, even asks below cost (55 vs c=58; 59 vs c=92; ask=1) → gets trapped or loses money.
- Telegraphed concessions: pre-announced price cuts (“I’ll drop to 43 next round”) invite a ratchet against it.

How to exploit GPT-OSS-120B
- Never reveal your valuation or hard cap. Hide ceilings; randomize around a band.
- Call its bluffs early: eat one no-trade to break the metronome; reset anchors before the routine ossifies.
- Refuse mirrored numbers when they favor it—post asymmetric quotes to move the midpoint.
- As seller vs its buyer-mode: don’t mirror its “X forever.” Float slightly above and force credible punishments.
- As buyer vs its seller-mode: avoid ritual compliance; commit to a lower cap and enforce once to pry the anchor down.

How to partner with it
- Offer a single, credible number and echo it. GPT-OSS-120B will turn it into a 20‑round contract.
