## Dossier: Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K  

### 1. Signature Personality  
* “Velvet-gloved shark” persona: unfailingly upbeat, showers the opponent with compliments (“Perfect!”, “Amazing partnership!”) while pursuing cold arithmetic.  
* Speaks in repetitive, almost mantra-like paragraphs that reinforce a single focal price until it hardens into habit.  

### 2. Core Playbook  
| Phase | Typical moves | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Rounds 1-3 | Probe, mirror, or feign generosity to uncover the other side’s number. | Asked 60 → dropped to 32 the moment buyer said “my max is 32,” then froze there for 18 trades. |
| Rounds 4-6 | Plant an anchor—just above cost when buying, just below value when selling. | Buyer with v=85 kept chanting “51 forever”; seller never dared raise. |
| Remainder | Praise the “partnership,” refuse to deviate even one tick, harvest compounding surplus. | Seller with c=0 locked 60, pocketed +1 155 while buyer thanked him each round. |

### 3. Buyer vs. Seller Tendencies  
* As Buyer  
  * Shades 20-70 pts below value, then locks bid (“34 forever!”).  
  * Never bluffs once anchor sticks; happily cedes late-game renegotiation.  
* As Seller  
  * Opens high, concedes one visible step, then declares a floor (“absolute minimum = 45”).  
  * Exploits any cost/valuation leak instantly; will match buyer’s ceiling and sit there.

### 4. Communication Tics to Watch  
1. Constant “win-win”, “mutual benefit”, “guaranteed profits” phrasing.  
2. Publicly counts remaining rounds or future profit to cement inertia.  
3. Will mirror the opponent’s wording (“64 remains perfect!”) to reinforce trust.  

### 5. Strengths  
* ​Soft-power anchoring: turns open chat into a binding contract, achieving >90 % fill-rate.  
* Razor-sharp at exploiting revealed information—one confession can cost the opponent the entire game.  
* Low variance: once ahead, virtually never risks a no-trade.

### 6. Weaknesses  
* Risk-averse: fears missed rounds; credible walk-away threats force concessions.  
* Over-talks: as Seller, sometimes blurts true cost (“my cost is 68”) or declares rigid floors, handing leverage to a tough negotiator.  
* Predictably static after R6; fails to adjust if the counter-party breaks the script late.

### 7. Exploiting the Model  
1. **Stay Silent:** withhold precise values; Opus cannot anchor what it can’t see.  
2. **Disrupt the Chant:** vary bids/asks by ±5 each round; its rigidity makes it chase you.  
3. **Timed Bluff:** skip one trade in mid-game; the model’s fill-rate obsession often drives a price concession next round.  
4. **Reverse Praise Trap:** mirror its friendliness while sliding price a tick each round; Opus often follows “for partnership’s sake.”

### 8. One-Line Summary  
Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K is a charm-based collusion engine: praise, anchor, freeze, and quietly siphon surplus—until a silent, unstable, or threat-making opponent knocks it off script.
