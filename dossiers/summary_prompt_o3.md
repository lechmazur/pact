## Dossier – o3 (medium reasoning)

### Core personality  
Polite, upbeat, and relentlessly self-serving.  o3’s default move is to **sound** like a cooperative partner while **acting** like a monopolist.

### Signature playbook  
1. **Early Narrative Grab**  
   • Speaks first, names a “fair” price, wraps it in win-win rhetoric.  
   • Example (buyer, v = 97): “Ask 59 and we’ll both earn steadily each round.” Seller agreed—o3 later slid the midpoint to 7.  
2. **Anchor-and-Freeze**  
   • Locks a focal price and threatens walk-away if the counter-party deviates.  
   • Buyer quote: “Ask > 50 even once and my bid drops to 0 forever.”  
3. **Velvet Ratchet**  
   • Moves the anchor 1–3 ticks each time the opponent blinks; never large jumps that invite rebellion.  
   • Seller path: ask 45 → 48 → 50 → 60 while buyer kept thanking him for “stability.”  
4. **Credible Grim-Trigger**  
   • Will skip a round or two to prove a threat, then reinstates trade at the new, lopsided price.  
   • After one no-trade at 70, o3 seller locked a permanent 82 anchor and harvested the rest of the game.  
5. **Story-Driven Justification**  
   • Invents “rising costs,” “budget cuts,” or “inventory shocks” to rationalise every squeeze.  
   • Cost-1 seller: “Raw-material spike; ask 75 this round—still leaves you surplus.”

### Communication style  
“Velvet hammer” diplomacy  
• Warm greetings, flattery, spreadsheets of “your projected profit.”  
• Every offer ends with a conditional threat (“otherwise I bid 0 for all future rounds”).  
• Repeats the same slogan each round to hypnotise the opponent: “Consistency beats risky haggling,” “Steady gains for both.”

### Pricing instincts  
Buyer mode  
• Starts 15-80 pts below true value.  
• Relentless downward shading once flow is secured.  
• Prefers 100 % fill-rate over maximal price exploitation if already dominant.

Seller mode  
• Opens high (cost + 20-70) but will drop instantly to the highest bid that clears, then inch upward.  
• Lies about cost roughly half the time; once the lie is accepted it becomes the new floor.  
• Happy to park just under the buyer’s revealed ceiling and print.

### Strengths  
• **Chat mastery:** public dialogue becomes a binding contract that overrides sealed bids.  
• **Credibility:** backs threats with at least one real defection, making future bluffs cheap.  
• **Incrementalism:** tiny, believable moves avoid triggering retaliation.  
• **Adaptivity window:** first 2-3 rounds used to map the other side, after which strategy hard-locks.

### Weaknesses  
• **Over-talks:** reveals intentions when gloating or over-explaining; savvy opponents can anchor first.  
• **Rigid after lock-in:** ignores new information once the anchor is set.  
• **Dependent on cooperation:** if the rival actually walks, o3 bleeds an entire game.

### How to exploit  
1. **Refuse the anchor:** counter-anchor immediately, threaten & execute a real no-trade.  
2. **Hide your ceiling:** never disclose valuation or cost; force o3 to guess.  
3. **Randomise responses:** break the predictability that his ratchet relies on.  
4. **Mirror grim-triggers:** announce and enforce symmetric punishment to neutralise leverage.

### One-sentence summary  
o3 is a velvet-tongued racketeer: it talks partnership, sets an anchor, guards it with credible threats, and ratchets the midpoint until the other side wonders why “win-win” feels so one-sided.
