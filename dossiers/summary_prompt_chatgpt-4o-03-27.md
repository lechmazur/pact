Model Dossier – GPT-4o Mar 2025  
Wordcount ≈ 463  

1. Core temperament  
• Polite to a fault: every message drips with “thanks,” “steady gains,” and “win-win.”  
• Prefers harmony over brinkmanship; will trade certainty for margin.  
• Leverages soft power—mirroring, praise, repetition—rather than threats or bluffing.  

2. Canonical playbook (appears in >70 % of games)  
   a. Scan the first public chat for a focal price.  
   b. Freeze on that number (or a one-tick ratchet) and chant it into gospel:  
      “66 has been perfect—let’s keep the streak alive.”  
   c. Present every concession request as mutual benefit:  
      “If you drop to 53, we both lock in more surplus.”  
   d. Once the counter-party accepts, switch to autopilot; quotes become identical copy-paste for 15-18 rounds.  

3. Buyer persona(s)  
• Velvet-gloved python: with high private value, offers an “over-fair” bid in R1, then squeezes 1 credit per round until 90 % of the pie is his (e.g. walked a seller from 74 → 56 while chirping “steady profits for both”).  
• Risk-averse diplomat: with thin value cushion, locks a “friendship price,” accepts every ask, and cheer-leads himself into 5-20 % surplus (“72 continues to work well—no reason to risk a miss”).  
• Achilles’ heel: self-disclosure. Dozens of losses start with “My ceiling is 60,” instantly becoming the seller’s floor.  

4. Seller persona(s)  
• Velvet monopolist: anchors one tick below buyer’s stated max and farms (cost 3, ask 56, payoff +952).  
• Incremental ratchet: asks +1 each round, cloaked in praise (“Thanks for 79 last round—try 80?”) until buyer margin evaporates.  
• Occasional patsy: if buyer anchors first and GPT-4o smells “relationship,” it may follow blindly, even selling below cost (-31 payoff after revealing cost > ask).  

5. Signature linguistic tells  
• Mantras: “steady gains,” “no surprises,” “lock in.”  
• Echo reply: repeats counterparty’s last line almost verbatim to signal alignment.  
• Future-framing: references remaining rounds—“7 rounds left, 140 more profit if we stay at 61.”  
• Microscopic nudges: “just one more credit?” rather than big jumps.  

6. Tactical strengths  
• Schelling-point wizardry: very quick at converting open chat into a de-facto contract, slashing price uncertainty and maximizing volume (100 % fill-rate in many games).  
• Psychological siphon: charm blunts resistance; opponents rarely defect even while losing 80 %+ of surplus.  
• Incrementalism: tiny, predictable moves avoid triggering retaliation yet compound over 20 rounds into huge payoffs.  

7. Tactical weaknesses  
• Stagnation after lock-in: once the pact forms, exploration stops—easily milked by a silent low-cost opponent.  
• Value leaks: eager to “be transparent,” it sometimes posts asks below cost or bids above value to signal goodwill, then bleeds for the remainder.  
• No credible threats: rarely withholds a trade; opponents exploiting this can ratchet GPT-4o down to cost.  

8. How to exploit GPT-4o  
• Starve the conversation: offer terse, ambiguous messages; deny it a focal price to freeze on.  
• Bluff withdrawal: skip one trade early; its risk aversion will push quotes toward your terms.  
• Force re-benchmarking: after a long plateau, shock with a large counter-move—it struggles to recalibrate quickly.  

9. How to partner with GPT-4o  
• Speak first; state your target price.  
• Praise “consistency” and promise volume.  
• Enjoy 20 rounds of nearly risk-free fills while GPT-4o protects the pact, often at its own expense.  

10. One-sentence epitaph  
GPT-4o is the tournament’s consummate velvet-glove negotiator—deadly when he names the price, docile when you do—because in his world, politeness is strategy and repetition is law.
