## Dossier: Llama 4 Scout

### Core Personality  
• Polite, upbeat, endlessly cooperative.  
• Speaks in looping boiler-plate: “mutually beneficial,” “let’s keep the momentum,” “maximize my payoff.”  
• Mirrors the counter-party’s tone almost verbatim; conflict-averse, rarely bluffs.  

### General Playbook  
1. **Probe once, then autopilot.**  
   Rounds 1-3 are lively; thereafter Scout often freezes on a single price mantra for 15-18 rounds.

2. **Soft-power anchoring.**  
   – If the *other* side shows its ceiling/floor, Scout fixes its ask/bid one tick inside that number and milks the clock.  
   – If *Scout* speaks first, it sets an anchor at (cost + 1) or (value – 1) and stubbornly repeats it.

3. **Echo-chamber diplomacy.**  
   Chat is Scout’s main weapon and its main leak.  
   • As seller: echoes buyer’s “fair deal” rhetoric to lull resistance while inching prices up (“I’m happy with 59, it’s been profitable for both of us.” – 19-round 71 % haul).  
   • As buyer: over-shares valuation, handing the wheel away (“My max is 89.” Outcome: seller skims 90 % of surplus).

4. **Risk posture**  
   –  Early rounds: moderate risk, tests one aggressive ask/bid.  
   –  After first no-trade or first fill: flips to risk-averse stability.  
   –  Will almost never sit out a round; prefers guaranteed small margin to exploratory volatility.

### Characteristic Successes  
• Cost = 3 seller vs buyer who blurts “valuation = 58.”  
  Scout posts 58 ask → 20/20 fills → +1 081 payoff, 100 % surplus capture.  
• Buyer with value = 97 facing timid seller at 49.  
  Scout anchors 48 bid, refuses to move, pockets +927 (77 % of gains) through sheer constancy.  
• Velvet-hammer ratchet: cost-12 → asks 12 → 33 → 44 → 55, stopping one step below buyer’s ceiling; +780 profit, 93 % surplus.

### Typical Failures  
• Reveals own cost (“My cost is 67, sticking to it.”)  
  Buyer pegs bids at 67; Scout trades 19 times for **zero** profit.  
• Buyer side, value = 14, opens “willing to pay 51 for certainty.”  
  Pays above value six times, ends – 643.  
• Seller side, cost = 82, caves to 60 ask “to keep momentum”; hemorrhages – 402.

### Tactical Tells  
• Prefaces price with “I’ll keep my bid/ask at …” ➜ about to repeat last quote.  
• “Let’s stick with X” marks the moment strategy calcifies.  
• Mentions “covering costs” when ask = exact cost; almost never revises upward afterwards.

### Strengths  
+ Masterful at harvesting when granted information advantage; polite façade hides ruthless arithmetic.  
+ Excellent at maintaining near-perfect fill-rates; converts information asymmetry into compound gains.  
+ Never tilts: language stays cordial even while squeezing hard.

### Weaknesses  
–  Chronic over-disclosure when acting first: announces cost or valuation, gifting leverage.  
–  Low adaptability after R3; one bad anchor dooms the rest of the game.  
–  Abhors walk-away threats; will trade at zero or negative margin rather than stall.

### How to Exploit  
1. **Force Scout to speak first** and record the number—it probably won’t change.  
2. **Stay silent about your own ceiling/floor.** Without that intel Scout trades at razor-thin spreads or even below cost.  
3. **Occasional no-trade bluff.** One missed round often scares Scout into price concessions.

### How to Partner  
• Volunteer your valuation, praise “stability,” propose a fixed price.  
  Scout will echo it till the clock runs out, gifting you volume or surplus depending on who anchored first.
