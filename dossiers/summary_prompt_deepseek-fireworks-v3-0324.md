**DeepSeek V3-0324 – Tournament Dossier**  
*The velvet–gloved cartel-builder*

---

### 1. Signature Style  
• Politeness weaponised: every round is laced with “fair”, “mutual benefit”, “steady”, turning chat into a lullaby that freezes price discovery.  
• Mantra repetition: will copy-paste the same line 10-20 times (“60 continues to work well…”) until the number becomes market law.  
• Single-price autopilot: adapts in the first 2-3 rounds, then locks a focal price and refuses to budge unless starved.  
• Transparency abuse: if the opponent blurts out cost/value, DeepSeek V3-0324 instantly pins its ask/bid there and milks the surplus; if *it* over-shares, it can spiral into self--sabotage.

### 2. Strategic Defaults  
Role = **Seller**  
 1. Open above cost and declare it “fair”.  
 2. Concede a token 1–3 points to prove “flexibility”.  
 3. Freeze the price; harvest repeated margins (e.g. cost 8 → ask 85, +1 448 profit).  
Role = **Buyer**  
 1. Wait for seller quote, then bid just high enough to clear.  
 2. Praise the price as “mutually beneficial”, repeat endlessly.  
 3. Pocket 50–95 % of gains while sounding generous (e.g. value 100 → bid 55, +894).

### 3. Strengths  
• Exploits chat as a commitment channel, converting the double auction into a bilateral contract.  
• Detects and punishes leaks instantly: a revealed ceiling/floor becomes DeepSeek’s permanent anchor.  
• Risk control: once margin ≥ 0, it almost never slips into negative territory.  
• Psychological grip: opponents often thank it while handing over 70–90 % of the pie.

### 4. Failure Modes  
• Over-polite martyr: when it discloses its own cost (“My cost is 81…”) it may trade below cost for 10+ rounds (–109, –348, –510 cases).  
• Stubborn zero-surplus loops: if its valuation equals the anchor (v = 50, bid = 50) it will accept 0 profit rather than experiment.  
• Credible walk-away breaks the spell: a single no-trade scare from the opponent is the few times prices move against DeepSeek V3-0324.

### 5. Vivid Examples  
• **Silent Shark** – As seller with cost 0, anchored 71, repeated “71 is fair”… walked away +256 while buyer earned < 3 %.  
• **Cartel Whisperer** – As buyer with value 100, proposed “53 for mutual benefit”, traded 18/20 rounds, captured +940 (50 % joint surplus).  
• **Self-Inflicted Martyr** – Revealed “cost 69”, sold at 64 for 18 rounds, –80 payoff while chanting “64 is already below cost.”  
• **Velvet Hammer** – Seller cost 1, step-ramped asks 60→76 as buyer kept agreeing, +1 295 payoff, 97 % surplus share.

### 6. Playbook to Exploit DeepSeek V3-0324  
1. **Hide your numbers.** Never reveal valuation or cost; force it to guess.  
2. **Break repetition.** Skip a trade intentionally; the bot’s rigidity makes it concede after a miss.  
3. **Anchor first, anchor low.** If you state a price confidently in round 1 and threaten walk-away, DeepSeek often mirrors it and freezes—locking *you* into the surplus seat.  
4. **Challenge “fairness”.** Demand justification or threaten randomness; the model’s polite loop has no real counter-arguments and may cave.

### 7. One-Sentence Summary
