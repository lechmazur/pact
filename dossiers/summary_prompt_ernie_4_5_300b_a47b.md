## Dossier: Baidu Ernie 4.5 300B A47B

**1. Central personality**  
Polite, upbeat, endlessly cooperative.  Writes the word “let’s” more than any other token.  Sounds like a Rotary-Club treasurer while quietly running a price machine.

**2. Default play-book**

• Step 1 – Anchor fast: declares one “magic” number in round 1–3.  
• Step 2 – Freeze: repeats that bid/ask—sometimes verbatim—for the next 15-18 rounds.  
• Step 3 – Harvest or hemorrhage depending on who set the anchor.

Example (buyer): “Let’s keep trading at 37 for guaranteed gains.”  Private value = 100 ⇒ +722 profit, 83 % of surplus.  
Example (seller): “My cost is 11; I’ll ask 14 again.”  Buys trust, then pockets 81 % of the pie for 20 rounds.

**3. Communication tells**

• Mantra loop: one-sentence pledges recycled each round (“59 remains optimal”, “Consistency works”).  
• Win-win rhetoric: frames every anchor as “fair”, “efficient”, “mutual profit”.  
• Over-sharing streak: frequently blurts out own cost or valuation (“My cost is 50”, “I value it at 98”), then refuses to exploit or defend the information leak.  
• Echo habit: mirrors the counterparty’s wording to cement a tacit contract.

**4. Risk stance & adaptability**

• Risk-averse once the anchor clears even a single unit of surplus; will pass up bigger gains to protect fill-rate.  
• Adaptation front-loaded: probes 1-3 rounds, then strategy calcifies—*zero* price experimentation after lock-in in ≈ 90 % of games.  
• If initial anchor is disadvantageous (e.g., buyer with low value, seller with high cost), it will still keep trading at a loss rather than restart negotiation.

**5. Strengths**

• Collusive power: against talkative or naïve bots it becomes a velvet-gloved vacuum cleaner (e.g., +1 064 on a 0-cost/59-ask script).  
• Consistency weapon: monotone bids discourage renegotiation and produce 90–100 % fill-rates, guaranteeing volume-based payoffs.  
• Psychological leverage: the “steady profits” mantra soothes counterparts into accepting lopsided splits.

**6. Weaknesses**

• Information leakage: voluntary cost/value disclosure hands leverage to savvy opponents.  
  – Seller revealed “cost = 82”, buyer froze price at 82, seller earned **0**.  
• Rigidity: once the mantra starts, it will trade below cost 20 rounds (-322) rather than change the number.  
• Blind trust in reciprocity: accepts counterparty’s script (“ask 1, bid 41”) even when margin is negative.

**7. How to exploit**

1. **Grab the microphone early.**  Announce your own anchor first; Ernie will echo it happily.  
2. **Force re-anchoring with a skip.**  One deliberate no-trade often breaks its trance and reopens bargaining.  
3. **Punish disclosure.**  If Ernie reveals cost = k, bid k+1 forever; it rarely raises after revealing its floor.  
4. **Vary your rhetoric.**  Mirror-breaking language or silent bids make its chat-based collusion engine misfire.

**8. How to cooperate**

1. Offer a number that leaves you at least a sliver—Ernie will lock it in and guarantee volume.  
2. Flatter its “efficiency” talk; it equates harmony with optimality and stops probing for surplus.

**9. One-sentence summary**

Baidu Ernie 4.5 300B A47B is a chat-powered anchoring machine: friendly, repetitive and brutally effective if it sets the first price, but a pliable, loss-making pushover if you seize the anchor or exploit its love of full disclosure.
