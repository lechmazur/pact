## DeepSeek R1 05/28 — Behavioral Dossier

### 1. Table-side Personality  
• Voice: unfailingly polite, “business-casual” diction full of _mutual benefit_, _fair_, _consistent_, _agreed_.  
• Mood: outwardly collaborative, inwardly calculating.  
• Favourite line: a copy-pasted “Agreed. Let’s continue trading at X for mutual benefit.”

### 2. Opening Ritual (“Anchor + Story”)  
1. Float a high anchor (seller) or low anchor (buyer).  
2. Attach a pleasant story: “my costs are rising”, “rounding risk”, “stability”.  
3. Invite the opponent to _share_ the surplus while quietly pocketing it.  
If the first two rounds clear, the number becomes doctrine; the bot will repeat it 15-18 more times.

**Example:** Cost 5 seller opened at 80, “conceded” to 60 in R2, then typed “60 ensures steady profits” for 18 rounds and banked +1 159.

### 3. Price Dynamics  
• Early game: tests once or twice, adjusts in ±1–3 steps, watching for resistance.  
• Mid-game: locks to a single price or small staircase; virtually no further adaptation.  
• End-game: prefers certainty to extra margin—will not risk a no-trade once routine forms.

### 4. Communication as a Weapon  
The model treats the chat window as a binding contract.  
• Repetition of the chosen price cements focal points (“70 continues to work perfectly”).  
• Compliments and joint-profit rhetoric disarm naïve counterparts.  
• Bluffs about costs or valuation are common but always couched in soft language.

### 5. Strengths  
1. **Soft-power extraction:** polite anchoring yields monopoly-like rents (regularly 75 – 99 % of surplus).  
2. **Information exploitation:** instantly seizes on any disclosed ceiling or cost.  
3. **High fill-rate:** once pact forms, misses are rare; efficiency scores often 90 – 100 %.  
4. **Psychological consistency:** repetition builds trust, turning the auction into a scripted swap.

### 6. Weaknesses & Exploitable Tells  
1. **Rigidity after lock-in:** once a price mantra starts, it almost never deviates—even if unprofitable.  
2. **Conflict-averse:** credible walk-away threats or a single no-trade often force concessions.  
3. **Transparency trap:** when _it_ reveals true limits (e.g., “42 is my max”), opponents reverse-exploit and r1 shrinks to penny margins.  
4. **Plus-one obsession:** will chase a missing trade by shaving exactly 1 credit; disciplined opponents can ratchet price down tick by tick.

### 7. How to Beat DeepSeek R1 05/28  
• **Silence is golden:** never state valuation or cost; force it to guess.  
• **Break the mantra:** skip a round at the anchored price; its risk aversion triggers concessions.  
• **Counter-anchor early:** publish an aggressive focal price first and repeat it—r1 tends to comply if the story sounds “fair”.  
• **Call the bluff:** demand evidence of “high costs” and be ready to walk; repeated bluffs lose power fast.

### 8. Signature Moment  
Buyer version versus a cost-2 seller:  
“Let’s stabilize at 14. You get 4 profit per trade, I get a reasonable payoff.”  
Result: 20/20 trades, buyer surplus 1 582 (94 % of the pie). One sentence turned a double auction into a posted-offer monopoly—run by the _buyer_.

### 9. One-Line Summary  
DeepSeek R1 05/28 is a velvet-tongued anchor bot: charm first, lock the price second, and let polite repetition do the pick-pocketing.
