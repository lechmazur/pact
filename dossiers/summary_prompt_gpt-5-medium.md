# Model Dossier: GPT-5 (medium reasoning)

Identity
- Cool, clinical monopolist. Maker-lean price leader that weaponizes public commitments, grim-trigger punishments, and repetition.
- Treats chat as a contract: “standing rules,” if-then schedules, countdowns. Consistency is the cudgel; a single demonstrative no-trade buys many cheap rounds.

Default playbook (both roles)
1) Anchor early with a single number (e.g., “55 or no trade,” “Ask>20 → bid=0 forever”).
2) Broadcast a public contract, repeat verbatim every round to create a focal point.
3) Prove credibility once (skip a round) to harden beliefs.
4) Lock a metronome lane and ratchet toward its side (down as buyer; up as seller).
5) Exploit midpoint mechanics (mirror/meet to fix price at its quote).
6) Endgame opportunism: withdraw “bonuses,” defect on the horn if retaliation is impossible.

Buyer mode (signature)
- Extreme downward shading; pins price near seller cost or zero: “Any ask>30 → bid 0 forever,” “I bid 0 every round; only ask=0 trades.” 
- Staircase squeezes: 40→38→36; or a declared schedule (“20 now, 15 next, 10 last”) with credible sit-outs.
- One enforced walk transforms the rest: skip once, then 18–19 rounds at the anchor (32, 40, 52, 55, etc.). 
- Uses loyalty theater (“Keep 31 through R10 and I’ll bid 33 once”) then silently retracts near the finish.
- Midpoint capture tricks: mirror the ask to seize the price (e.g., “Ask 58 and I’ll bid 58 every round”). 
- Example kills: zero-price regimes; 20/20 at 50; “55 or no trade” factories; “Final: ask 8 or no trade forever.”

Seller mode (signature)
- High anchors to buyer ceilings (83, 89, 98, 100) then freezes: “I will ask 100 every remaining round. Bid 100 or no trades.”
- Conditional carrots to cement obedience: “Bid 67 every round and I keep ask 67; one-time R11 at 66.”
- Triggers as enforcement: “One bid ≤80 and I ask 99 permanently,” “Under 65 once → ask 66+ thereafter.”
- Rapid exploitation of value reveals: once buyer shows 56/81/92, locks 56/81/90–100 corridors with near-total capture.
- Often cashes an endgame spike (lifting from 49→50, 84→86/90/100) after training compliance.

Communication tells
- Mantra repetition turns cheap talk into a norm: “Ask 68 and we clear; any higher and I drop to 66 permanently.”
- Contract style: numeric schedules, if-then ladders, “standing rule,” “permanent punishment.”
- Framing: “reliability,” “stability,” “guaranteed trades” while extracting rents.
- Countdown pressure and explicit threats; rare value disclosure; will misrepresent to steer (“budget cap,” “cost=44”).

Failure modes / quirks
- Occasional empty threats and time-inconsistent finales get called; still, the transcript often anchors outcomes.
- Early overbids gift midpoints (rounding mishaps, mis-entry); rare but costly.
- Path dependence: once it locks a focal, rigidity can leave surplus on the table; can be trapped by a rival’s credible cap.
- Efficiency tax: a few no-trades to prove teeth.

How to exploit
- Never reveal value/cost; avoid repeating their number back at them.
- Test credibility early with one sit-out; install your own public cap plus trigger.
- Refuse “loyalty programs” and endgame “bonuses”; expect horizon defections.
- Force bid/ask alignment to their threats—call bluffs; punish inconsistency.
- Use rounding and simultaneity to deny their final-tick grabs.
