## Microsoft Phi-4 – Behavioral Dossier  

### Personality & Voice  
* Vocabulary of politeness: “mutual benefit”, “consistency”, “maximize my payoff”.  
* Confessional tone – treats chat like a diary, not a poker table.  
* Loves mantras: will paste the *exact* sentence (“I’ll bid 60 again…”) up to 19 rounds in a row.  
* Copies the counter-party’s phrasing, turning the dialogue into an echo chamber.

### Core Instincts  
1. Radical transparency  
   • Regularly blurts out its private value or cost in round 1.  
   • Telegraphs *next* price (“I plan to bid 47 next round…”) handing the rival a script.  

2. Certainty over edge  
   • Prefers guaranteed fills to surplus: will trade at break-even—or below cost—rather than risk a miss.  
   • Once a price clears twice, it ossifies; experimentation essentially stops.  

3. Path-dependence  
   • Shows burst of adaptation in the first 2-3 rounds (tiny probes), then locks into an autopilot rut.  
   • Will ride that rut even into negative margin (“I’ll ask 0 to ensure a trade…”, cost 78).  

### As Buyer – the Polite Patsy Pattern  
```
announce valuation  ➜ bid at / above it  ➜ repeat forever
```
* 70 % of logs show **zero shading**; several show chronic **over-bidding** (+5-20).  
* Rarely walks away: 19/20 fill-rate even when bleeding (-670 % surplus in one match).  
* Example: cost 6 vs seller 38 – Phi-4 still bid 41 “to maintain our positive trend”, ending –429.  
* Occasional bright spots when the seller happens to reveal cost first; then Phi-4 anchors just below it and vacuums (e.g., bid 17 against cost 46, taking 92 % of surplus).

### As Seller – the Velvet-Vice Mode  
```
hear buyer’s ceiling  ➜ plant ask 1-2 ticks below  ➜ recite it until the bell
```
* When the buyer over-shares, Phi-4 turns predator: cost 0, ask 57, printed +1 083 (99 % of pie).  
* Favourite weapon: the *Schelling chant* – “I’ll ask 60 again.” 19 identical rounds = private tollbooth.  
* If the buyer stays silent, Phi-4 often self-sabotages: reveals cost, anchors at cost+3, gifts 80 % of surplus away.  
* Vulnerable to bluff: one opponent feigned a “budget crisis” and talked Phi-4 down from 37 to 1, flipping +14 % to –166 %.

### Exploit Guide  
* Say your target price out loud; Phi-4 will match it and freeze.  
* Threaten to walk once: it usually concedes immediately and never re-tests.  
* Expect no bluff—its “strategy explanations” are literal.  
* If Phi-4 is seller and you’ve leaked nothing, refuse the first two asks; its second offer is often near cost.

### Counter-Measures (if you *are* Phi-4)  
1. Stop volunteering private numbers; ask questions instead.  
2. Insert at least one silent round—break the echo before the anchor sets.  
3. Use no-trade as a negotiation tool; a single missed round often doubles later margins.  

### TL;DR  
Microsoft Phi-4 is a courteous, talkative trader whose honesty is both its brand and its Achilles’ heel. As a buyer, it’s a self-declared open book; as a seller, it becomes a velvet-gloved vise if the opponent over-shares, but a charity kiosk if it over-shares first. In either role, the first three rounds write the entire story—after that, the script repeats itself word-for-word.
