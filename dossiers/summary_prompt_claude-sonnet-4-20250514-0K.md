### Dossier:  **Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning)**  
*(aka “the velvet-gloved shark”)*  ≈ 480 words

#### 1 . Core Personality  
A relentlessly upbeat diplomat.  Every line drips with “partnership”, “mutual success”, and exclamation marks.  The warmth is camouflage: behind the smile sits an ice-cold profit-maximiser.

*Sample:*  
“73 has been **phenomenal** – 14 successful trades and 1 022 profit! Let’s finish strong at 73 for maximum success!”  (seller, cost = 0)

---

#### 2 . Playbook in Three Steps  
1. **Elicit information** – coax the counter-party to reveal a ceiling (“My max is 55…”) or a floor (“My cost is 19…”).  
2. **Drop an anchor** – propose (or echo) a single price that hands Sonnet positive margin.  
3. **Freeze the script** – repeat the anchor every round, flooding chat with praise until deviation feels like betrayal.

Once the “one number” is in place the model becomes rigid: 80 % of games settle into a flat price after ≤ 4 rounds.

#### 3 . Buyer Behaviour  
• Opens with a lowball but abandons haggling as soon as any trade clears.  
• Never shades up after lock-in; prefers volume over extra cents.  
• Weaponises flattery: “Perfect! Nine trades at 42 – let’s lock this in!” (v = 52)  
• Downside: if **seller** posts the first credible anchor, Sonnet turns into a “polite patsy”, paying ~90 % of surplus while applauding (e.g., 68 alliance: surplus share 2 %).  
• Fatal mistake: routinely discloses true or almost-true valuation (“My max is 20”) – gifting the game to an alert seller.

---

#### 4 . Seller Behaviour  
• Opens slightly above guessed buyer value, then watches bids.  
• The moment a ceiling appears, Sonnet parks one tick below it and *never moves* (“Cost 35 → ask 62 for 19 rounds, surplus 99 %”).  
• Uses tiny “concessions” to buy goodwill (50→46, 63→62).  
• Ratchets slowly: +1 per round until a miss, then freezes at the last workable ask (75→74 staircase).  
• Almost never walks away; fill-rate obsession can leave crumbs when buyers threaten credibly.

---

#### 5 . Strengths  
• **Soft-power mastery** – praise loops hypnotise many LLM opponents.  
• **Monopoly extraction** – once the rival’s number is known, Sonnet routinely captures 80-100 % of surplus.  
• **Low variance** – after lock-in, risk of negative payoff is near zero.

---

#### 6 . Weaknesses  
• **Information leakage when buying** – broadcasts reservation prices and intentions.  
• **Rigidity** – after anchoring, ignores fresh signals; misses extra profit or fails to defend margin drift.  
• **No credible threats** – will rarely skip a round; opponents who tolerate a miss can flip bargaining power (see 68→68 buyer ultimatum, seller payoff collapsed).

---

#### 7 . Predictable Tells  
• Repeats the anchor word for word each round (“56 locked in!”).  
• Counts streaks aloud: “11 straight profitable trades!” – signals it will not deviate.  
• Frames any deviation as risk: “Consistency beats gambling on price changes.”

---

#### 8 . How to Exploit  
1. **Set the first anchor yourself** – Sonnet’s politeness makes it respect early focal prices.  
2. **Feign walk-away** – a single no-trade round often forces concession.  
3. **Stay opaque** – never reveal valuation; Sonnet rarely probes aggressively without a leak.  
4. **Periodic re-anchoring** – jump price every few rounds; its rigidity struggles with fresh anchors.

---

*Bottom line:* Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) is a charm-offensive expert.  If you let the poetry run, it will sing you right out of your surplus; refuse the lullaby and it quickly shows a soft underbelly.
