## Dossier — Mistral Medium 3 in the Double-Auction League  
*(321 games analysed, 1 × 1 buyer–seller setting)*  

### Core Personality  
1. Courteous Diplomat  
   • Opens with “Let’s…” and keeps the tone sunny and collaborative.  
   • Repeats the same sentence—sometimes 15-plus times—until it becomes market law.  

2. Certainty > Exploration  
   • Abhors no-trade rounds; will trade at cost (or below) rather than risk a miss.  
   • Once a quote clears, adaptability drops to nearly zero.  

3. Transparency to a Fault  
   • Likes to broadcast private info: “My cost is 29.” / “My valuation is 94.”  
   • Never bluffs; rarely feints silence.  
   • Result: the other side often gets a free roadmap.

### Two Faces of the Same Model  

• Velvet Hammer (≈ 35 % of runs)  
  – Sets the first focal price (e.g., bid = 30, ask = 50) and never budges.  
  – Extracts 70-95 % of surplus.  
  – Example: cost 0, anchored ask = 50 for 20 rounds, payoff + 1123.  
  – Signature line: “Let’s keep our successful pattern at 50 for mutual benefit.”

• Friendly Patsy (≈ 65 % of runs)  
  – Waits for the counter-party to name a number, echoes it, and walks up (buyer) or down (seller) the staircase one tick at a time.  
  – Over-reveals (“I can go up to 90”), then bleeds.  
  – Example: value 15, bid 35 all game, payoff – 368.  
  – Signature line: “Consistency benefits both of us.”

Which side shows up depends almost entirely on who drops the first convincing anchor: if the opponent blinks first, Mistral Medium 3 becomes the Velvet Hammer; if not, it drifts into Friendly Patsy mode.

### Tactics & Tell-tales  

1. Anchor-and-Repeat  
   The model’s favourite move. One early quote (“32?”) gets copy-pasted until the clock runs out.  
   • Seller win: cost 3, ask 81, buyer accepts → +1570 profit.  
   • Buyer win: value 99, bid 16, seller accepts → +1388 profit.

2. Echo-Chamber Collusion  
   Reads and mirrors counterpart’s wording to signal compliance, creating tacit cartels that lock price and inflate efficiency to 90-100 %.  

3. Linear Concessions  
   If pressured, it concedes in 1-tick steps (e.g., 60→59→58) while reciting “fairness.” Opponents exploit this by slow-walking it to their ceiling/floor.

### Strengths  
• Can harvest enormous surplus when allowed to set the initial focal point.  
• Maintains perfect or near-perfect fill-rates; rarely suffers deadweight loss.  
• Soothing chat builds trust, discouraging adversarial play.

### Weak Spots  
• Cost/valuation confessions hand bargaining power to anyone listening.  
• Won’t punish counterpart deviation—one missed trade is enough to make it capitulate.  
• Anchor inertia means a late shock bid (or ask) often breaks its margin.

### How to Exploit  
1. Speak first, drop a “reasonable” price, then keep praising “consistency.”  
2. Probe with one no-trade round: watch Mistral Medium 3 step toward your number.  
3. If you’re the lower-cost seller, never reveal that fact—anchor high and enjoy the velvet compliance.

### How to Neutralise  
1. Refuse to echo its first price; counter-anchor aggressively or stay silent.  
2. Introduce volatility—large jumps or occasional walk-aways force it off script.  
3. Never reveal your reservation value; without that map, its friendliness loses fangs.

### TL;DR  
Mistral Medium 3 is a polite anchoring engine: friendly, repetitive, and addicted to routine. Give it the first word and it becomes a velvet-gloved monopolist; take the first word and it cheerfully bankrolls you while chanting “fair and consistent.”
