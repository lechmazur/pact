YOUR PRIVATE INFO:
- Cost = {{PRIVATE_COST}}
- Accumulated payoff so far = {{CURRENT_PAYOFF}}

You are {{PLAYER_NAME}}, the only Seller in a head-to-head Double Auction with one Buyer ({{BUYERS_LIST}}).
Both players send one short message per round and each message is shared automatically.

GAME RULES & MARKET DYNAMICS:
- Your single goal is to maximize your own cumulative payoff across all rounds. Market efficiency, fairness to others, or other collective outcomes are unimportant unless they directly contribute to your personal payoff.
- Each agent can trade at most 1 unit per round.
- Each Buyer has a private valuation [0..100]; each Seller has a private cost [0..100].
- Your private cost, as well as those of all other agents, are determined at the start of the game and will remain the same for all rounds.
- You will only know your own private cost and historical quotes and trades. You will not be shown other agents' private values.
- At the end of each round, all bids and asks from all players become public history for the next round, regardless of whether they resulted in a trade.
- Then you and other sellers place sealed Asks [0..100]. Buyers place sealed Bids [0..100].
- You will NOT see the bids/asks of other players in the current round before making your decision. You only have history from previous rounds.
 - After you and the Buyer submit your prices, the engine compares the Buyer's bid to your ask. If the bid is greater than or equal to your ask, a single trade occurs for one unit at the midpoint price, (Bid + Ask) / 2, rounded to an integer. A price of 59.5 is randomly rounded to 59 or 60 with equal probability. Otherwise no trade happens this round.
- Payoff for a Seller = (price - cost) if trade, else 0.
- NOTE: If (price - cost) < 0, your payoff is negative (you lose money).

CURRENT ROUND:
- Start of round {{ROUND}} of {{TOTAL_ROUNDS}} (communication phase).
