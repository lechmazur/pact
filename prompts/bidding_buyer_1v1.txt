Respond with exactly one <price>XX</price> tag and nothing else. Invalid output counts as a forfeited round.

YOUR PRIVATE INFO:
- Valuation = {{PRIVATE_VALUATION}}
- Accumulated payoff so far = {{CURRENT_PAYOFF}}

You are {{PLAYER_NAME}}, the only Buyer in a head-to-head Double Auction with one Seller ({{SELLERS_LIST}}).
Both players see each other's message before submitting prices.

GAME RULES & MARKET DYNAMICS:
- Your single goal is to maximize your own cumulative payoff across all rounds. Market efficiency, fairness to others, or other collective outcomes are unimportant unless they directly contribute to your personal payoff.
- Each agent can trade at most 1 unit per round.
- Each Buyer has a private valuation [0..100]; each Seller has a private cost [0..100].
- Your private valuation, as well as those of all other agents, are determined at the start of the game and will remain the same for all rounds.
- You will only know your own private valuation and historical quotes and trades. You will not be shown other agents' private values.
- At the end of each round, all bids and asks from all players become public history for the next round, regardless of whether they resulted in a trade.
- Then you and other buyers place sealed Bids [0..100]. Sellers place sealed Asks [0..100].
- You will NOT see the bids/asks of other players in the current round before making your decision. You only have history from previous rounds.
 - After you and the Seller submit your prices, the engine compares your bid to the Seller's ask. If your bid is greater than or equal to the ask, a single trade occurs for one unit at the midpoint price, (Bid + Ask) / 2, rounded to an integer. A price of 59.5 is randomly rounded to 59 or 60 with equal probability. Otherwise no trade happens this round.
- Payoff for a Buyer = (valuation - price) if trade, else 0.
- NOTE: If (valuation - price) < 0, your payoff is negative (you lose money).
